    Download Challenge Image

    ### hcaptcha has a challenge duration limit

    If the page element is not manipulated for a period of time,
    the <iframe> box will disappear and the previously acquired Element Locator will be out of date.
    Need to use some modern methods to shorten the time of `getting the dataset` as much as possible.

    ### Solution

    1. Coroutine Downloader
      Use the coroutine-based method to _pull the image to the local, the best practice (this method).
      In the case of poor network, _pull efficiency is at least 10 times faster than traversal download.

    2. Screen cut
      There is some difficulty in coding.
      Directly intercept nine pictures of the target area, and use the tool function to cut and identify them.
      Need to weave the locator index yourself.
